# GroupMe Dark Mode

This is an extension which attempts to add a dark mode to the GroupMe web app. It's not the most beautiful, nor the most performant, but I'd say it's good enough.

If you're tired of your eyes burning when you tab over to GroupMe at 3am, look no further; this is the extension you've been looking for.
